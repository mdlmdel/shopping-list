# Shopping List App Challenge

In this challenge, I practiced managing state in a jQuery web app. I began with HTML and CSS starter files that provided the skeleton for the design. I then focused on learning how to build the functionality to use DOM manipulation and traversal to dynamically add, check, and delete items in the shopping list app.
